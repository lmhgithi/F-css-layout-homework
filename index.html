          How will AI affect our life? 
          There are different viewpoints between different people. 
          There are several notables, such as Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates, 
          worrying about the development of AI. They are afraid that the abuse 
          of artificial intelligence technology is likely to usher in a smart 
          explosion situation, then the machine will continue to enhance their 
          own skills and knowledge, and finally get beyond the humanâ€™s IQ. What's 
          worse, they might attain emotion. In other words, the machine may be out 
          of control at the end and even control the world on the contrary.

          However, optimistic opinions are also accepted by numerous people. 
          They are totally convinced that AI can bring more convenience,
           more efficient and more wealth to us. Most significantly, 
          AI will enhance human productivity, then promote social development.

        <h2>Article 3</h2>
        <p>
          From where I stand, I am in favor of artificial intelligence, 
          because it can apply to all kinds of fields and lead us to a more 
          convenient life. For example, when we need some medical help, 
          there may be no necessary to go to hospital anymore. What we need 
          is a smart phone embed a medical AI robot, which can check our health 
          condition. Can you image how convenient and fast that is? 
          Although those pessimistic ideas are reasonable, 
          I believe that the benefits of AI outweigh the disadvantages.
